- Preferably use temporal models like in forex, recurrent neural network, LSTM, etc
- Select data sources (pycoingecko good so far, don't know how good the data is)

**Metrics to consider**

- Price (temporal)
- Volume
- Market cap
- Sentiment (tweepy can be used)
- News (will look for API, maybe scrape finviz)
